# Description
This is a project that I will be working on that will display recorded car accidents using the VDOT database and displaying it on the state map. I will also be keeping track of the total accidents per day and the map will clear every 24 hours. I was able to automate downloading the CSV, now I just need to figure out how to convert each line item into a marker on the map... maybe another workflow...
